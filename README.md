# Calculator

A simple console calculator (in the process of being) written in Python.

Input like "5 + 6 * 4^2 *(2 + 4)"

As this converts infix expressions to postfix then evaluates, sometimes the answer is incorrect
However, this small project fufilled its purpose, which was for me to learn about using the stack and learing how expressions are evaluated
